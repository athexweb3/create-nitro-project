# Contributing

We want this community to be friendly and respectful to each other. Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Development workflow

To get started with the project, run `bun install` in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:

```sh
bun i
```

## Linting and tests

We use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for linting and formatting the code.

```sh
bun tsc
bun lint
bun format
```
